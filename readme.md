# Credly API Demo

This app is a simple demo of the Credly API being implemented into a Laravel app. You can sign into this app using your Credily account to see your profile and badges.

## Starting the App

Homestead and vagrant are configured, so a 'vagrant up' will startup a virtual machine.

In the Laravel .env file, you'll need to provide your Credly API credentials as follows:
CREDLY_KEY={put token here}
CREDLY_SECRET={put token here}
